# The Greatest Reset (greatestresetmovie.com)

This is the greatestresetmovie.com website converted to Quasar 2 & hooked to a customized Strapi admin
for end user authentication. The end users in Strapi have a corresponding zype consumer for use with
registration required or money transactions required on zype content. This allows an access_token
from zype to be retrieved when signing in to Strapi.
